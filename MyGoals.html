    <h1> Goals</h1><br>

<p > 
    I need to have the program make goals and then maunel strikethrough.
    Make check boxes. Something all of catergory s in code for this. Then also get portfolio. 
    I have been trying to decide what I want to do for my livin life. 
    How do you decide without trying new thing till you get intersted into something.
    I thought I would be a Electrian, but then discover coding.
    These decisons are not easy to make when you jmp to different ideas so easisly.
    I have a mind that never stops and when I try to game for a awhile I stop.
    I have recently got into puzzling which is fun because no matter what the piece will fit eventually.
