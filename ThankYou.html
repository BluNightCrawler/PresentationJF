      <h1>Thank You</h1>
  <p>For barry with my code and some of the developemnets someof them are not strong. They may still need work done to them
    I means some of them do not even work at the moment becasue I need more coding experience on my belt. I seem to get something not link to it and then it doesnt add up
    I want to program games as you saw about my break out game now I want to add 2 player games. Mystery games. web develpoment needs improvement that ok that will come ina s time go.
    Thanks Again for everyhtig and Hoepfully my next quarter I wil lget better as the year moves on. one thing I know is that I need to continue coding and not stop or I will lose the skills I have learned.
  </p>
