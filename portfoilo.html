    <h4>Science Project</h4>
    <p>This project will have two different animation. One with a closed Capsule which then makes the 
      Soundwaves move towards the Open side. But when the sides are both open then the soundwaves move
      together. In Code I used Different shapes to make the cylinder shape and with a retangle to make it look clean.

  <h4>You want To Order Pizza</h4>
  <p>I am making some javascript relate to the project to make a reciept for the person to make a pizza. 
    Which then will caculate there order of food and tell them the price. I am using butons and appply to make more then one pizza
    This will be a tough and working project through out maybe even after this class is done. 
    The Backwards and front of the project is what needs to be work ut so it work with each other and overall it just a big projedct.
    Not trying to make it simple trying to make it be able to give a price retain that and then add the price to next pizza they want.
    When they press the sumbit button it will give the final total.

    <h4>FirstJob Idea Before Coding</h4>
    <p>This was when I was in Highline I had a few coding and this is what I came up with how little knowledge I had before 
      I even learned to code and have better techique. But with comparing this to what I have made to this project there is a lot of improvements.
      But this doesnt mean that I know everything I mean shoot my teacher is still learning so I have a lot to still learn. But taking it a step by step because some times it a lot.
