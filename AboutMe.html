  <p>
    So if you have no learned about me I have some really good goals which means I have to put more work into. 
    This means time and motivated personality to get this done. I am Jeremiah France 
    I play sports on my free time and video games, Which includes puzzles. I was on the 
    Basketball, Baseball, and Cross country team in Highschool. I like to eat but it seems to becoming a programmer you forget the time and
    when to eat unless your work is done. I work at Dominoes, I am Youth Leader For my church some of my roles outside of school.
